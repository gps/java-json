The org.json package for parsing json in Java found at http://www.json.org/java/ was written with a much older version of Java. As a result when included in an Eclipse project, it produces several warnings, which often mask real warnings. 

To solve this problem, I added @SuppressWarning annotations where appropriate. The code is otherwise unchanged. 

I also reformatted the package with my Eclipse default formatting.
